Final one-week project for my last year at Ecole Centrale de Lille as a group of four contributors.

The goal was to control and organize several robots handling a warehouse ( entrep√¥t in french ).

I succeded to simulate several robots having to colect and drop items without colliding each other thanks to mutex and semaphores for resource conflicts.
